Changelog has been moved to [the releases tab](https://github.com/roginfarrer/react-collapsed/releases).

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1ee93e8: ## BREAKING CHANGES

  - Adopts React 18's `useId`, making the library incompatible with React <18
  - Switch to `tsup` from `microbundle` for bundling library. No longer exports a UMD version, just CJS and MJS

  ## Features & Bug fixes

  - Refactors core functionality to vanilla JS (with a React) adapter, which I think should fix #103 and fix #100
  - Added `onExpandedChange` option
  - Tries to detect if `getToggleProps` is used. If the toggle element ref can be accessed, the `aria-labelledby` attribute will be added to the collapse element
  - Added `role="region"` to collapse
  - Updated toggle props to pass the appropriate attributes to the element, whether it's a button or not

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [1ee93e8]
  - @collapsed/core@4.0.0

- Library now exports a custom hook in lieu of a render prop component
- Adds support for unmounting the contents of the Collapse element when closed

```js
import React from 'react'
import useCollapse from 'react-collapsed'

function Demo() {
  const { getCollapseProps, getToggleProps, isOpen } = useCollapse()

  return (
    <>
      <button {...getToggleProps()}>{isOpen ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand'}</button>
      <section {...getCollapseProps()}>Collapsed content ðŸ™ˆ</section>
    </>
  )
}
```
