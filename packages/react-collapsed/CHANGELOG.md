## 4.0.1

### Major Changes

- 5e427ec: This is a big refactor of `react-collapsed`, enough I wanted to denote it with a new major version.

  ## BREAKING CHANGES

  - `expandStyles` and `collapseStyles` options have been removed.
  - `onExpandStart`, `onExpandEnd`, `onCollapseStart`, `onCollapseEnd` options have been removed and replaced with `onTransitionStateChange`:

    ```typescript
    const useCollapse({
      onTransitionStateChange(stage) {
        switch (stage) {
          case 'expandStart':
          case 'expandEnd':
          case 'expanding':
          case 'collapseStart':
          case 'collapseEnd':
          case 'collapsing':
            // do thing
          default:
            break;
        }
      }
    })
    ```

  ## Other changes

  - Unique IDs for accessibility are now generated with `React.useId` if it's available.
  - Styles assigned to the collapse element are now assigned to the DOM element directly via a ref, and no longer require `ReactDOM.flushSync` to update styles in transition.
  - Added `role="region"` to collapse.
  - Added logic to handle disabling the animation if the user has the prefers reduced motion setting enabled.
  - Replaced animation resolution handling to a programmatic timer, instead of the `'transitionend'` event. Should fix #103.
  - Improved the types for `getCollapseProps` and `getToggleProps`, so their arguments and return type is more accurately typed. This should help catch cases when props returned by the getters are duplicated on the component (such as `ref` or `style`).
  - Changes the props returned by `getToggleProps` depending on the HTML tag of the component.

# 2.0.0

Complete rewrite using React hooks!

- Ends support for React versions < 16.8.x
- Library now exports a custom hook in lieu of a render prop component
- Adds support for unmounting the contents of the Collapse element when closed

```js
import React from 'react'
import useCollapse from 'react-collapsed'

function Demo() {
  const { getCollapseProps, getToggleProps, isOpen } = useCollapse()

  return (
    <>
      <button {...getToggleProps()}>{isOpen ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand'}</button>
      <section {...getCollapseProps()}>Collapsed content ðŸ™ˆ</section>
    </>
  )
}
```

# 1.0.0

Bumped to full release! :)

- `duration`, `easing`, and `delay` now support taking an object with `in` and `out` keys to configure differing in-and-out transitions
